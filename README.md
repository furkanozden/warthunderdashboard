<h1>War Thunder SimHub Dashboard FIP Gauges</h1>

As a result of my long research, I couldn't find any SimHub panels for War Thunder. So I made one myself. But I don't know why, some planes show some values, some don't. I tried to do as much as I could. I guess some information can be pulled from localhost:8111 using javascript. I couldn't do it because I wasn't an expert on JS.

<i>I tried to do the best in visuality. It is up to the community to fill the remaining gaps (:</i>
