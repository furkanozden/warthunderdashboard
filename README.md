<h1>War Thunder SimHub Dashboard FIP Gauges</h1>

As a result of my long research, I couldn't find any SimHub panels for War Thunder. So I made one myself. But I don't know why, some planes show some values, some don't. I tried to do as much as I could. I guess some information can be pulled from localhost:8111 using javascript. I couldn't do it because I wasn't an expert on JS.

<i>I tried to do the best in visuality and some codes. It is up to the community to fill the remaining gaps (:</i>

<h3>Credits</h3>

Like I said, I did a lot of research. While I was doing this research, I came across a project by SÃ©bastien Matton. The indicators were beautifully designed. I used these visuals to make the panel. To browse his project, follow the link below:

English is not the main language. I hope I can explain myself.
